            This Movie Hunt Application was designed to help movie fanatics  <br> search for a movie of their interest with a detailed description of the movie to help distinguish between selecting it to watch it or continuing to  search for a movie. <br> We strongly believe our application was designed to help improve movie searching easier and give users quick feedback to make a decision based on genre, rating, and movie reviews from the New York Times.
